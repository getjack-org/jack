# Jack Promo Scripts

## Target Audience

Vibe coders / agentic coders - people who ship 10+ experiments a week using AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Replit, etc). Their biggest pain point is deployment - only 4-5% use AI for deployment tasks.

## Positioning

**GitHub + Vercel for agentic coders**

## Video Specs

- Format: Small face in lower corner, screencast the whole time
- CTA: `bunx @getjack/jack new my-app`
- Lengths: 50 sec (Twitter) + 90 sec (landing page/YouTube)

"Every vibecoder I know has the same problem."

"100 experiments scattered everywhere. Each with its own secrets, deploy setup, config you already forgot."

[Terminal: jack new launch-app -t miniapp]
"jack new."

[Deploy animation, live URL copies to clipboard]
"Scaffolds, installs, deploys. Live URL copied."

"Build with whatever agent you like."

[Terminal: jack ship]
"Ship."

[New URL appears instantly]
"That's it."

[Terminal: jack new experiment -t launch-app]
"Want to try something without breaking it?"

[Second deploy, second URL]
"Fork any project. No git setup. It just works."

[Terminal: jack ls showing organized projects]
"jack ls. Every project. Local and cloud. Organized."

[End card]
"GitHub and Vercel for agentic coders."
"bunx @getjack/jack new my-app"
```

### Announcement Tweets

**Option A - Problem/Solution:**
```
100 AI-built projects scattered across your machine.
Each with secrets you forgot, config you'll never touch again.

jack: GitHub + Vercel for agentic coders.
One command to create. One command to ship. One place to find everything.

bunx @getjack/jack new my-app
```

**Option B - Bold claim:**
```
jack is GitHub + Vercel for vibecoders.

- jack new → live URL before your first commit
- jack ship → zero-config deploys
- jack ls → all your experiments, organized

Your AI writes the code. jack handles the rest.

bunx @getjack/jack new my-app
```

**Option C - Short & punchy:**
```
Built 47 apps with Claude this month.
Finally have a place to put them all.

jack - ship before you forget why you started.
```

## Direction 1: "The Missing Piece" (Backup)

**Angle:** AI writes code fast. Deploying is still slow. Jack fixes that.

### 50-sec Script

```
[Screen: Claude Code terminal, code streaming]
"AI can write your app in 60 seconds."

[Terminal freezes, cursor blinks]
"Deploying it? Still 30 minutes of wrangler config, secrets, TOML debugging."

[Type: jack new my-app -t miniapp]
"jack new."

[Deploy animation, URL appears]
"Live URL. Before your first commit."

[Type: jack new fork -t my-app]
"Fork it."

[Second URL appears]
"Another live URL. No git setup, no config."

[Show: jack ls with multiple projects]
"All your experiments. One place."

[End card: bunx @getjack/jack new my-app]
"Ship before you forget why you started."
```
