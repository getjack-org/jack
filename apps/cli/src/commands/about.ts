  In Gibson's Neuromancer, "jacking in" means plugging
  consciousness directly into cyberspace. The meat body
  becomes irrelevant—you're pure thought in the matrix.

  jack handles the meat work (infra, config, deployment)
  so you stay in creative flow. Think it, ship it.

  The shortest path from "what if" to "here's the link."

  Built for vibecoders who ship 10 experiments a week.
