# jack publish

Make your project forkable by others.

## Usage

```bash
jack publish
```

## Requirements

- Project must be deployed (run `jack ship` first)
- You must have a username set (prompted during first login)

## What Happens

1. Verifies you own the project
2. Checks your latest deployment has source available (created automatically on `jack ship`)
3. Makes the project visible for forking by any logged-in jack user

## After Publishing

Others can fork your project with:

```bash
jack new my-fork -t yourusername/your-project
```

Your project URL format changes to include your username:
- Before: `your-project.runjack.xyz`
- After: `yourusername-your-project.runjack.xyz`

Both URLs continue to work.

## Example

```bash
# Create and deploy a project
jack new cool-api -t api
cd cool-api

# Make some changes, then deploy
jack ship

# Publish for others to fork
jack publish
# Output: Published as alice/cool-api
# Output: Fork with: jack new my-app -t alice/cool-api
```

## Notes

- Publishing is one-way (no unpublish yet)
- Source is downloadable by any authenticated jack user (not open to the public internet)
- Forked projects are completely independent copies
- Your deployed worker continues running normally
