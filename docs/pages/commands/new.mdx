# jack new

Create a new project from a template.

## Usage

```bash
jack new [name] [options]
```

### First-Time Usage

No install needed — run directly with `bunx`:

```bash
bunx @getjack/jack new my-app
```

Jack auto-initializes on first run. Auth is handled interactively.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Project name (optional, will prompt if not provided) |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-t, --template` | Template to use (see below) |

## Templates

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `hello` | Default starter (Hono API) |
| `api` | Hono API with examples |
| `miniapp` | Farcaster Frame mini-app |
| `nextjs` | Next.js on Cloudflare |

## Forking Projects

Every project you deploy with `jack ship` becomes a template you can fork.

```bash
# Fork your own project
jack new my-new-api -t my-existing-api

# Fork someone's published project
jack new my-fork -t alice/cool-api
```

| Format | Access |
|--------|--------|
| `-t my-project` | Your own projects (private) |
| `-t username/project` | Published projects (public) |

### Your Personal Template Library

Every `jack ship` saves a source snapshot. This means:

- **Build on your own work** — Start new projects from proven foundations
- **No extra steps** — Just deploy normally, forking is automatic
- **Private by default** — Only you can fork your projects (unless you `jack publish`)

From your project directory (for example, `/projects/my-great-api`):

```bash
jack ship
```

Now start something new based on it:

```bash
jack new my-new-thing -t my-great-api
```

### Publishing for Others

Want others to fork your work? Publish it:

```bash
jack publish
```

Then anyone can fork with `jack new -t yourname/project`.

## Examples

```bash
# Interactive mode
jack new

# Create with a name
jack new my-cool-app

# Use a builtin template
jack new my-api -t api

# Fork your own project
jack new v2 -t my-existing-api

# Fork a published project
jack new my-version -t alice/her-api
```

## What Happens

1. Creates a new directory with your project name
2. Copies template files (or downloads from published/your project)
3. Installs dependencies
4. Deploys with `jack ship`
5. Opens your AI agent

Your project is live before you write a line of code.
