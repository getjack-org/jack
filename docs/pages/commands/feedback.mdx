## What Gets Sent

The feedback includes some metadata to help us understand context:

| Data | When Included |
|------|---------------|
| Your message | Always |
| jack version | Always |
| Operating system | Always |
| Project name | Only if telemetry enabled |
| Deploy mode | Only if telemetry enabled |
| Email | Only if logged in and telemetry enabled |

## Privacy

Your privacy is respected:

- **No telemetry?** Project info and email are not included
- **`DO_NOT_TRACK=1`** Disables metadata collection
- **`JACK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`** Same effect
- **CI environments** Metadata is automatically minimal

## Notes

- Requires an interactive terminal (won't work in CI)
- For bugs in CI environments, open an issue at [github.com/getjack-org/jack](https://github.com/getjack-org/jack)
- We read every piece of feedback
