# jack projects

Manage and discover your jack projects.

## Usage

```bash
jack projects [command]
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `list` | List all projects (default) |
| `info <name>` | Show detailed project info |
| `remove <name>` | Remove a project from tracking |
| `cleanup` | Find and remove stale entries |
| `scan <dir>` | Discover projects in a directory |

## jack projects list

Lists all your projects, grouped by location. Same as `jack ls`.

```bash
jack projects list
# or simply
jack ls
```

**Output:**

```
  ~/dev/apps/
  ├── my-app      [live] https://alice-my-app.runjack.xyz
  └── test-api    [local only]

  ~/projects/
  └── wip-project [live] https://alice-wip-project.runjack.xyz

  On jack cloud (no local files)
  └── old-project [live] https://alice-old-project.runjack.xyz

ℹ 3 projects (2 live, 1 local-only)
```

## jack projects info

Show detailed information about a project.

```bash
jack projects info my-app
```

**Output:**

```
ℹ Project: my-app

  Status: local, deployed, backup

  Workspace path: ~/dev/apps/my-app

  Worker URL: https://alice-my-app.runjack.xyz
  Last deployed: 1/2/2025, 3:45:00 PM

  Backup: 12 files
  Last synced: 1/2/2025, 3:46:00 PM

  Account ID: abc123...
  Worker ID: xyz789...

  Database: my-app-db

  Created: 12/15/2024, 10:00:00 AM
```

Run from a project directory to auto-detect the name:

```bash
cd my-app
jack projects info
```

## jack projects remove

Remove a project from jack's tracking. This does **not** undeploy the worker.

```bash
jack projects remove my-app
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--yes` | Skip confirmation prompt |

**What gets removed:**
- Entry from local registry
- Entry from jack cloud (if using managed mode)

**What stays intact:**
- The deployed worker (use `jack down` to undeploy)
- Cloud backups
- Databases

## jack projects cleanup

Find and remove stale registry entries—projects that have URLs but no deployed worker.

```bash
jack projects cleanup
```

Useful for cleaning up after manual deletions or failed deployments.

## jack projects scan

Discover jack projects in a directory and register them locally.

```bash
jack projects scan ~/dev
```

This is helpful when:
- You've cloned projects that jack doesn't know about
- Projects show as "cloud only" even though local files exist
- You want to import existing Cloudflare Workers projects

**What it looks for:**
- Directories with `wrangler.toml` or `wrangler.jsonc`

**Example:**

```bash
jack projects scan ~/dev
# ⏳ Scanning ~/dev for jack projects...
#
# ℹ Found 3 project(s):
#   ├── my-app       ~/dev/my-app
#   ├── test-api     ~/dev/test-api
#   └── old-worker   ~/dev/legacy/old-worker
#
# ✓ Registered 3 local path(s)
```

## Aliases

- `jack ls` → `jack projects list`
- `jack info` → `jack projects info`
