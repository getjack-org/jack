# jack ship

Deploy your project to the edge.

## Usage

```bash
jack ship
```

Run this from your project directory. That's it.

## Auto-Detection

jack automatically detects your framework and generates the right config:

| Framework | What jack does |
|-----------|----------------|
| Vite (React, Vue, etc.) | Builds and deploys as static assets |
| Hono | Deploys as a Worker with your entry point |
| SvelteKit | Builds with adapter-cloudflare, deploys |

No `wrangler.json` needed. jack creates it for you.

### Coming Soon

These frameworks are detected but need manual setup for now:

- Astro
- React Router v7
- Nuxt
- TanStack Start

Run `jack ship` in these projects to see setup instructions.

## What Happens

1. Detects your project type
2. Generates config (if needed)
3. Builds your project
4. Uploads to Cloudflare Workers
5. Your changes are live in seconds

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--debug` | Show detailed deployment logs |
| `--dry-run` | Test detection and build without deploying |

## Examples

```bash
# Deploy current project
jack ship

# Test detection without deploying
jack ship --dry-run

# Deploy with debug output
jack ship --debug
```

## Notes

- First deploy may prompt for Cloudflare authentication
- Subsequent deploys are instant
- Every deploy saves a source snapshot (forkable via `jack new -t project-name`)
