# Using with AI Agents

jack is the deployment platform for Claude Code. Here's how to get the most out of it.

## Claude Code

Claude Code is the primary agent for jack. Every project includes context files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) and there's a built-in MCP server for direct deployment and service management.

### Quick Start

```bash
bunx @getjack/jack new my-app
```

Claude Code can then use the MCP tools or CLI to deploy, add databases, and manage your project.

## MCP Server

jack includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets AI agents deploy and manage projects directly.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_project` | Create and deploy a new project |
| `deploy_project` | Deploy the current project |
| `get_project_status` | Check deployment status |
| `list_projects` | List all projects |

### Setup

The MCP server is configured automatically when you run `jack new`. It adds configuration to:

- Claude Code (`~/.claude/mcp.json`)
- Claude Desktop (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`)

### Manual Setup

To manually start the MCP server:

```bash
jack mcp serve
```

## Other Agents

jack also works with other AI coding agents (Codex, Cursor, etc.) via CLI commands and `--json` output. The MCP server is compatible with any agent that supports the Model Context Protocol.

## AGENTS.md

Every jack project includes an `AGENTS.md` file with instructions for AI agents. This helps your coding agent understand your project structure.

## Preferred Agent

jack can automatically open your preferred coding agent after creating a project:

Set your preferred agent:

```bash
jack agents prefer claude-code
```

Available: `claude-code`, `codex`.

Now `jack new` will open your agent automatically:

```bash
jack new my-app
```

## Tips for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Let the agent deploy** - AI agents can run `jack ship` directly
2. **Use the MCP tools** - Agents with MCP access can create/deploy without CLI
3. **Check AGENTS.md** - Customize it for your project's specific patterns
