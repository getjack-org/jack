# Using with AI Agents

jack is built for AI-assisted development. Here's how to get the most out of it.

## MCP Server

jack includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets AI agents deploy and manage projects directly.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_project` | Create and deploy a new project |
| `deploy_project` | Deploy the current project |
| `get_project_status` | Check deployment status |
| `list_projects` | List all projects |

### Setup

The MCP server is configured automatically when you run `jack new`. It adds configuration to:

- Claude Code (`~/.claude/mcp.json`)
- Claude Desktop (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`)

### Manual Setup

To manually start the MCP server:

```bash
jack mcp serve
```

## AGENTS.md

Every jack project includes an `AGENTS.md` file with instructions for AI agents. This helps Claude Code, Cursor, and other tools understand your project structure.

## Preferred Agent

jack can automatically open your preferred coding agent after creating a project:

```bash
# Set your preferred agent
jack agents prefer claude-code  # or: cursor, windsurf

# Now `jack new` will open your agent automatically
jack new my-app
```

## Tips for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Let the agent deploy** - AI agents can run `jack ship` directly
2. **Use the MCP tools** - Agents with MCP access can create/deploy without CLI
3. **Check AGENTS.md** - Customize it for your project's specific patterns
