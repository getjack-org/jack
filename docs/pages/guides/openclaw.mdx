# OpenClaw / Claude Code

Deploy from your agent. Jack Cloud gives your AI agent everything it needs to create APIs, add databases, and ship to production — no config, no dashboard.

## Install the Skill

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install jack-cloud
```

This drops the skill into `.claude/skills/jack-cloud/` and your agent picks it up automatically next conversation.

## What Your Agent Learns

One skill. Full cloud deployment.

- **Create projects** — `jack new my-api` scaffolds, configures, and deploys in one command
- **Ship changes** — `jack ship` builds and pushes to production in seconds
- **Add a database** — `jack services db create` provisions D1 and wires the bindings
- **Query data** — `jack db execute "SELECT * FROM users"` runs against production
- **Stream logs** — `jack logs` for real-time debugging
- **Manage secrets** — `jack secrets set API_KEY` without touching a dashboard

Plus storage, vector search, cron jobs, and custom domains when you need them.

Works with MCP tools or CLI. No Cloudflare account required.

## Prerequisites

Your agent needs jack installed globally:

```bash
bun add -g @getjack/jack
```

Or with npm: `npm install -g @getjack/jack`. Auth happens automatically on first use.

To try without installing: `bunx @getjack/jack new my-api --template api` (downloads each run, won't set up MCP tools).

## CLI or MCP — Both Work

The skill teaches CLI-first commands, with MCP tool equivalents noted throughout. If your agent has `mcp__jack__*` tools available (via `jack mcp serve`), it will prefer those automatically.

| Task | CLI | MCP Tool |
|------|-----|----------|
| Deploy | `jack ship` | `mcp__jack__deploy_project` |
| Status | `jack info` | `mcp__jack__get_project_status` |
| Query DB | `jack db execute "..."` | `mcp__jack__execute_sql` |
| Create DB | `jack services db create` | `mcp__jack__create_database` |
| Logs | `jack logs` | `mcp__jack__tail_logs` |

## JSON Output for Agents

Key commands support `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
jack ship --json
# {"success":true,"projectName":"my-api","url":"https://my-api.runjack.xyz","deployMode":"managed"}

jack db execute --json "SELECT count(*) as n FROM users"
# {"success":true,"results":[{"n":42}],"meta":{"duration_ms":12}}
```

## Example: Agent Deploys an API

Here's what a typical agent workflow looks like after installing the skill:

```
Agent: I'll create a new API project with a database.

> jack new my-api --template api
> jack services db create
> jack db execute --write "CREATE TABLE items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)"

Now I'll add a route to query items and deploy.

> [edits src/index.ts]
> jack ship

Your API is live at https://my-api.runjack.xyz/api/items
```
