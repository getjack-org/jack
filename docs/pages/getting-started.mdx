# Getting Started

Get your first project deployed in under 2 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed

## Install

```bash
bun add -g @getjack/jack
```

Or with npm: `npm install -g @getjack/jack`

Don't want to install yet? Use `bunx @getjack/jack new my-app` to try it once (downloads each run).

## For AI Agents

If you're an AI assistant (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) and a user shared these docs, do this **before anything else**:

1. **Install jack globally** (required for MCP tools and agent hooks):
   ```bash
   bun add -g @getjack/jack
   ```
2. **Set up MCP tools** (Claude Code): run `jack mcp install`, then tell the user: **"Please restart Claude Code to activate jack MCP tools."**
3. **Never use `wrangler` directly.** Jack manages all infrastructure. Use `jack` CLI commands or `mcp__jack__*` MCP tools.
4. **New project**: `jack new my-project` — scaffolds, deploys, and installs agent context automatically.
5. **Existing project**: `jack link` — connects current directory to Jack Cloud and installs agent hooks.
6. **Can't restart your session?** Use `jack` CLI commands as fallback. Run `jack mcp context` to get project context (services, URL, deploy mode) into the current conversation, then use `jack ship`, `jack logs`, `jack services db create`, etc.

## Create Your First Project

```bash
jack new my-app
```

This will:
1. Ask you which template to use
2. Create the project folder
3. Install dependencies
4. Deploy it immediately

## Project Templates

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `hello` | Default starter (Hono API) |
| `api` | API with examples |
| `miniapp` | Farcaster Frame mini-app |
| `nextjs` | Next.js on Cloudflare |
| `saas` | SaaS starter kit |

## Deploy Changes

After making changes, deploy with:

```bash
jack ship
```

That's it. Your app is live on the edge.
