# Templates

jack comes with starter templates to get you building fast. Each template is batteries-included and deploys in seconds.

## Builtin Templates

| Template | Description | Features |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `hello` | Default starter | Hono API, TypeScript |
| [**api**](/templates/api) | API with examples | Hono router, CORS, multiple endpoints |
| [**miniapp**](/templates/miniapp) | Farcaster Frame mini-app | React, Vite, D1 database, Neynar API |
| `nextjs` | Next.js on Cloudflare | SSR, OpenNext, edge runtime |
| `saas` | SaaS starter kit | Auth, billing, dashboard |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive - prompts for template
jack new my-app

# Direct - specify template
jack new my-app -t api
jack new my-miniapp -t miniapp

# Fork someone's published project
jack new my-fork -t alice/her-project
```

## Template Philosophy

Templates follow the **omakase** principle: batteries-included, ready to use, no configuration needed.

### What's Included

- All runtime dependencies pre-installed
- `bun.lock` for fast installs (~5s vs ~12s)
- Working example code you can modify
- Deployment configuration ready to go
- `AGENTS.md` for AI-assisted development

### What's Not Included

- Deployment tools (wrangler is installed globally by jack)
- Unused optional features
- Boilerplate you'll delete anyway

## Publishing Your Project

Any jack project can become a template for others to fork:

```bash
# Deploy your project first
jack ship

# Make it forkable
jack publish
```

After publishing, others can fork with `jack new my-copy -t yourusername/your-project`.

See [`jack publish`](/commands/publish) for details.

## Forking Published Projects

Fork any published project to get your own copy:

```bash
jack new my-version -t alice/cool-api
```

This:
1. Downloads the source code
2. Creates a new project under your account
3. Deploys it to your own URL

The forked project is completely independent—you own it and can modify it however you want.

## Creating Custom Templates

Templates are just folders. Want to add one? See the [template development guide](https://github.com/getjack-org/jack/blob/main/apps/cli/templates/CLAUDE.md).
