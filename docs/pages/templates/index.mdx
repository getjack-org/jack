# Templates

jack comes with starter templates to get you building fast. Each template is batteries-included and deploys in seconds.

## Available Templates

| Template | Description | Features |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| [**miniapp**](/templates/miniapp) | Farcaster Frame mini-app | React, Vite, D1 database, Neynar API |
| [**api**](/templates/api) | Hono API endpoint | Hono router, CORS, TypeScript |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive - prompts for template
jack new my-app

# Direct - specify template
jack new my-app -t miniapp
jack new my-api -t api
```

## Template Philosophy

Templates follow the **omakase** principle: batteries-included, ready to use, no configuration needed.

### What's Included

- All runtime dependencies pre-installed
- `bun.lock` for fast installs (~5s vs ~12s)
- Working example code you can modify
- Deployment configuration ready to go
- `AGENTS.md` for AI-assisted development

### What's Not Included

- Deployment tools (wrangler is installed globally by jack)
- Unused optional features
- Boilerplate you'll delete anyway

## Creating Custom Templates

Templates are just folders. Want to add one? See the [template development guide](https://github.com/hellno/jack/blob/main/templates/CLAUDE.md).
