# Ship before you forget why you started.

Ever find yourself with a dozen half-finished projects scattered across your machine? Each one was going to be *the thing*, but then you had to set up env vars, configure secrets, figure out deployment... and suddenly it's 2am and you're debugging TOML syntax instead of building.

Your AI wrote the app. Now it's rotting in localhost because deploys are *a whole thing*.

```bash
jack new my-app
```

That's it. Live URL. No config files, no deployment ceremony, no context-switching to dashboards.

```bash
bun add -g @getjack/jack
```

Or try without installing: `bunx @getjack/jack new my-app`

## Philosophy

**Infrastructure should disappear.** The best deploy tooling is the kind you don't think about. `jack new` works immediately—no accounts, no config, no ceremony. If you need to read docs before shipping your first project, we've failed.

**Creation is free.** You'll have dozens of experiments. That's the point. jack never blocks you from creating because old projects exist. `jack ls` shows everything; cleanup is optional, never forced.

**No lock-in.** Everything jack creates is standard tooling—wrangler.jsonc, package.json, TypeScript. Your projects work without jack installed. We earn continued use through convenience, not capture.

---

## Who this is for

Vibecoders. People who ship experiments constantly. Solo devs with more ideas than weekends.

You move fast. AI makes it worse—now you can prototype anything in an afternoon. But each prototype needs its own env vars, secrets, deploy config. The ceremony piles up. Creative momentum dies.

jack handles the boring parts. You stay in flow.

---

## Why jack?

- **Instant deployment** — `jack new` creates AND deploys. One command, live URL.
- **Works with your agent** — Every project includes context files so your AI understands the stack.
- **Roaming secrets** — Configure once, use across all projects. No per-project ceremony.
- **Project tracking** — Projects scattered everywhere? `jack ls` finds them all.

---

## Zero-config deploys

`jack ship` auto-detects your framework. No config files needed.

```bash
jack ship
```

That's the deploy.

| Supported | Coming Soon |
|-----------|-------------|
| Vite, Hono, SvelteKit | Astro, React Router, Nuxt, TanStack |

---

## Every deploy becomes a template

Ship something, then start something new from it:

```bash
jack new my-new-thing -t my-existing-project
```

Build on your own work. Private by default.

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `jack new <name>` | Create and deploy a new project |
| `jack ship` | Redeploy current project |
| `jack ls` | List all your projects |
| `jack open` | Open project in browser |

## Why "jack"?

In Gibson's *Neuromancer*, jacking in meant plugging directly into cyberspace. The body becomes irrelevant—you're pure thought in the matrix.

jack handles the infrastructure so you stay in creative flow. The boring parts disappear. You just build.
