## **Ship before you forget why you started.**

jack removes the friction between your idea and a live URL.

## Install

```bash
bun add -g @getjack/jack
```

Then create and deploy your first project:

```bash
jack new my-app
```

Or try without installing: `bunx @getjack/jack new my-app`

You'll need [Bun](https://bun.sh) and a Cloudflare account (free tier works).

## Why jack?

- **Instant deployment** — `jack new` creates AND deploys. You have a live URL before your first commit.
- **Works with your agent** — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, whatever. Every project includes AI context files so your agent understands the stack.
- **Roaming secrets** — Configure once, use across all projects. No more per-project secret ceremony.
- **Project tracking** — 100 experiments scattered everywhere? `jack ls` finds them all.
- **No lock-in** — Standard config files, standard TypeScript. Your projects work without jack installed.

## Zero-Config Deploys

`jack ship` auto-detects your framework. No config files needed.

```bash
jack ship
```

| Supported | Coming Soon |
|-----------|-------------|
| Vite, Hono, SvelteKit | Astro, React Router, Nuxt, TanStack |

## Your Personal Template Library

Every deploy becomes a forkable template. Build on your own work:

Ship a project:

```bash
jack ship
```

Later, start something new from it:

```bash
jack new my-new-thing -t my-existing-project
```

No extra steps. Private by default. [Learn more →](/commands/new#forking-projects)

## Launch Day Flow

Frame is the zero-overhead scaffolding project-management tool for agentic coders. The [Launch Day Flow](/guides/jack-cloud-flow) guide mirrors the video commands, calls out the jack cloud flow, and makes the same benefits obvious next to the SPIRIT principles.

## Who This Is For

Builders who ship constantly. You spin up new projects all the time, and suddenly you have dozens scattered across your machine—each with its own env vars, secrets, and deploy setup you've already forgotten.

jack keeps you organized. One command to ship, one place to find everything, zero setup overhead. Stay creative, skip the ceremony.

## Philosophy

In Gibson's *Neuromancer*, "jacking in" means plugging directly into cyberspace. The body becomes irrelevant—you're pure thought in the matrix.

jack handles the infrastructure so you stay in creative flow. The boring parts disappear. You just build.
